# Project Design Document

## Core Technology Decisions

### LLM Selection
- **Generation Model**: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 via Ollama recommended
  - *Hardware analysis*: Intel i7-12700H with 16GB RAM can handle 7B parameter models efficiently
  - *Options analyzed*:
    - **DeepSeek**: Higher reasoning capabilities but more resource-intensive (10GB+ RAM usage)
    - **Mistral-7B**: Better balance of performance and efficiency (8-10GB RAM usage)
    - **Phi-3-mini**: Most efficient option if performance constraints emerge (4-6GB RAM usage)
  - *Rationale*: Mistral-7B models provide an excellent balance of quality and performance on your hardware, with enough headroom for other applications
  - *Specific recommendation*: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 offers strong instruction-following capabilities while maintaining efficiency
  - *Context window*: ~8K tokens with standard configuration, sufficient for most humanities text chunks

### Embedding Strategy
- **Embedding Model**: Nomic Embed Text via Ollama
  - *Rationale*: High-quality open-source embedding model that can run locally, maintaining data privacy while providing competitive performance.
  - *Alternatives considered*: OpenAI embeddings (rejected due to privacy concerns), Sentence Transformers (rejected due to slightly lower performance).

### Chunking Approach
- **Strategy**: Semantic chunking
  - *Rationale*: Humanities texts often have meaningful structural elements (paragraphs, sections) that should be preserved. Semantic chunking respects these boundaries better than fixed-size chunking.
  - *Implementation approach*: Use natural breaks in text (section markers, paragraph breaks) rather than arbitrary token counts.
  - *Adaptation plan*: As dataset grows, may need to implement hierarchical chunking to handle longer documents.

## Architecture Decisions

### Storage Strategy
- **Document Store**: Qdrant (embedded mode) recommended
  - *Options analyzed*:
    - **Chroma**: Lightweight but limited filtering capabilities
    - **Weaviate**: Feature-rich but requires Docker, higher resource usage
    - **Pinecone**: Cloud-based, not ideal for privacy-focused local deployment
    - **Milvus**: Enterprise-grade but complex setup, resource-intensive
    - **Qdrant**: Good balance of features and performance
  - *Recommendation*: Qdrant in embedded Python mode offers excellent performance with reasonable resource consumption, strong filtering capabilities, and no external dependencies
  - *Considerations*: Can start with embedded mode and migrate to service mode if dataset grows

### Retrieval Mechanism
- **Approach**: Hybrid retrieval with re-ranking
  - *Initial implementation*: 
    - Vector similarity using nomic-embed-text
    - Simple keyword matching for terminology precision
    - Metadata filtering based on Obsidian tags and links
  - *Later refinement*: 
    - Two-stage retrieval with LLM-based re-ranking
    - Retrieve top-k results (k=10-20) with hybrid approach
    - Use LLM to score relevance more precisely
    - Return top-n most relevant results (n=3-5)
  - *Considerations*: Balance between retrieval quality, computational efficiency, and response time

### Processing Pipeline
- **Structure**: [Decision needed]
  - *Options*: Sequential pipeline, event-driven architecture, task queue
  - *Considerations*: Asynchronous vs. synchronous processing, error handling

## Interface Decisions

### Obsidian Integration
- **Approach**: [Decision needed]
  - *Options*: Plugin development, file system watcher, manual export
  - *Considerations*: User workflow, technical complexity, maintenance burden

### Gradio Interface
- **Design Philosophy**: [Decision needed]
  - *Options*: Minimal research tool, comprehensive analysis dashboard, focused single-purpose tool
  - *Considerations*: Target users, learning curve, development time

## Implementation Specifics

### Semantic Chunking Implementation
- **Approach**: Context-aware text segmentation
  - *Implementation*: Use natural language processing to identify semantic boundaries (paragraphs, sections, arguments)
  - *Chunk size target*: 1000-2000 tokens with 100-200 token overlap
  - *Special considerations*: Preserve citation relationships and contextual references common in humanities texts
  - *Example algorithm*:
    1. Split on section headers
    2. For long sections, split on paragraph boundaries
    3. Ensure minimal chunk size to maintain context
    4. Add metadata about source location and relationship to other chunks

### Ollama Integration
- **Connection method**: RESTful API
  - *Implementation*: Use Python requests library for simplicity
  - *Caching strategy*: Cache embeddings and frequently requested generations
  - *Model management*: Create wrapper class to handle model loading, parameter settings, and error handling
  - *Fallback mechanism*: Include error handling for when model is unavailable or response quality is low

## Operational Decisions

### Evaluation Framework
- **Metrics**: Mixed-method approach
  - *Quantitative*: Relevance scoring, response latency, contextual accuracy
  - *Qualitative*: Domain expert review of sample outputs, contextual appropriateness
  - *Implementation*: Create evaluation harness with sample queries and expected outcomes
  - *Considerations*: Balance between computational metrics and humanities-specific quality assessment

### Deployment Strategy
- **Distribution**: GitHub repository with comprehensive documentation
  - *Setup*: Provide clear installation instructions with dependency management
  - *Documentation*: Include sample notebooks demonstrating workflows for digital humanities use cases
  - *Versioning*: Semantic versioning with clear changelog
  - *Considerations*: Focus on reproducibility and ease of setup for humanities researchers

### Future Scalability
- **Growth Plan**: Start single-user with extensible architecture
  - *Initial scope*: Focus on personal knowledge management integration with Obsidian
  - *Extension points*: Design clean interfaces for:
    - Alternative document sources
    - Different embedding/LLM models
    - Custom processing pipelines
  - *Potential paths*: 
    1. Multi-user through shared document repository
    2. Web service deployment through FastAPI
    3. Specialized plugins for different humanities subdomains
