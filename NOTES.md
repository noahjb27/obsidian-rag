I need to add conversation ability.

Really limited by Memory and weak LLM. - Not sure if this can be improved.

Progress Log on initialisation not actually displaying in frontend/Initialisation Status is not quite right:

"System initialized successfully!
Processed 7 notes into 0 chunks.
New: 7, Updated: 0, Unchanged: 72, Deleted: 0
Total processing time: 21.59 seconds." -  even though it should have just loaded what was there before I think, unless the metadata does not get updated
